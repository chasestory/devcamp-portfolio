<h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>Hello, Welcome to the about-me section of my personal portfolio. My name is Chase Story, I am 24 years young, and have been a full-stack (mainly backend) developer. </p>

        <p> I have been working at Tranont managing databases, and rebuilding our Customer Depolyment System, and websites. We have also been working on rebuilding our associate portal for a more modern; up to date operation. 

        I also work with a few select clients, updating website content, managing databases, and assiting in regular maintenance.</p>
